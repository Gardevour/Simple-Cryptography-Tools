      <p>
        In cryptography, a Caesar cipher, also known as Caesar's cipher, the
        shift cipher, Caesar's code, or Caesar shift, is one of the simplest and
        most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution
        cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter
        some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, with a
        left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and so on.
        The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private
        correspondence.

        The encryption step performed by a Caesar cipher is often incorporated
        as part of more complex schemes, such as the Vigenère cipher, and still
        has modern application in the ROT13 system. As with all single-alphabet
        substitution ciphers, the Caesar cipher is easily broken and in modern
        practice offers essentially no communications security.
