          In cryptography, a Caesar cipher, also known as Caesar's cipher, the
          shift cipher, Caesar's code, or Caesar shift, is one of the simplest
          and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of
          substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced
          by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For
          example, with a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would
          become B, and so on. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used
          it in his private correspondence.

          The encryption step performed by a Caesar cipher is often incorporated
          as part of more complex schemes, such as the
          <a href="../Vigenère Cipher/index.html">Vigenère cipher</a>, and still
          has modern application in the ROT13 system. As with all
          single-alphabet substitution ciphers, the Caesar cipher is easily
          broken and in modern practice offers essentially no communications
          security.

          In order to determine the decryption key for your cipher text. Simple
          take the totalnumber of characters in the alphabet (26), and subtract
          the key you used to encrypt the message. For example: A string
          encrypted with key: 10, can be decrypted with key: 16.
