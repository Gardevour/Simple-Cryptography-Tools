# Simple-Cryptography-Tools

This project aims to create and collect tools for encrypting and
decrypting messages using simple ciphers and algorithms, written in
HTML/Javascript. The javascript language is chosen as it doesn't
require compilation, and can run on any computer as long as it has a
browser.
