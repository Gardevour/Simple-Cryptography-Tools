          Cryptography, or cryptology (from Ancient Greek: κρυπτός, romanized:
          kryptós "hidden, secret"; and γράφειν graphein, "to write", or -λογία
          -logia, "study"), is the practice and study of techniques for secure
          communication in the presence of adversarial behavior. More generally,
          cryptography is about constructing and analyzing protocols that
          prevent third parties or the public from reading private messages.

          This project aims to create and collect tools for encrypting and
          decrypting messages using simple ciphers and algorithms, written in
          HTML/Javascript. The javascript language is chosen as it doesn't
          require compilation, and can run on any computer as long as it has a
          browser.
